# Rule-Based Library Chatbot
## Qualitative Assessment – 3
### Course: Artificial Intelligence
### Unit: 3

## Objective
To design and implement a rule-based chatbot using predefined rules,
similar to early AI systems without using AI, ML, or NLP libraries.

## Description
The Library Chatbot responds to common library-related queries using
rule-based reasoning and keyword matching.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Rule-based logic
- No AI / ML / NLP libraries

## Working
User input is checked against predefined keywords.
If a match is found, the corresponding response is displayed.

## Sample Rules
- "hours" → Library timings
- "borrow" → Borrowing rules
- "fine" → Late return fine

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates early AI systems using rule-based reasoning.
